Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
Code Explanation
Initialization: i gets a value of 0 and its used as a counter.
Condition: the subsequent code is executed as long as i is lower than the length of myArr (which is 5; five numbers but arrays are zero based).
Final-expression: i is incremented by 1.
Statement: The function adds myArr[i]'s value to total until the condition isnâ€™t met like so:
total + myArr[0] -> 0 + 2 = 2 
total + myArr[1] -> 2 + 3 = 5
total + myArr[2] -> 5 + 4 = 9
total + myArr[3] -> 9 + 5 = 14 
total + myArr[4] -> 14 + 6 = 20
